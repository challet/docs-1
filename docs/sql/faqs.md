## Does Tableland support foreign keys?

No, not at this time as there are potential determinism issues involved.

## Can I use subqueries in write statements?

Only "flattened" subqueries are supported within `INSERT` statements but are not possible in `UPDATES`. For read queries, nesting subqueries is perfectly acceptable. See the [docs for more info](/sql/write#inserting-data).

## Does Tableland support numbers with decimals values?

No, because floating points are hard to deal with in decentralized systems due to non-deterministic behavior. So, blockchains and related infrastructure have to adopt whole integer values and arithmetic, instead.

## Does Tableland support types for dates or times?

No, because these lead to non-deterministic behavior. But, you are free to store these values as `TEXT` or `INTEGER` types, and the custom `BLOCK_NUM()` and `TXN_HASH()` functions can help a bit here, too.

## Can I update _more than one_ table in a single transaction?

Yes, mutating queries (inserts, updates, deletes) can touch _one or more tables at a time_. Keep in mind that if one of the statements fail, they all fail.

## Are all SQLite functions supported?

No—and read the [SQL functions docs](/sql/functions) for details!

## How do I escape single quotes within a SQL string literal?

SQL string literals (e.g., a table with a TEXT value) are wrapped single quotes. In order to use a single quote within the string literal, double the single quote that must be escaped:

```sql
INSERT INTO escape_table (id, VALUES (0, 'My string''s escaping!')
```

## What's the difference between single and double quotes in SQL?

A simple rule to remember which to use and when:

- [**S**]ingle quotes are for [**S**]tring Literals
- [**D**]ouble quotes are for [**D**]atabase Identifiers
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO
    "my_table" ("id", "val")
  VALUES
    (0, 'Bobby Tables');
  ```

## Can I use lowercase letters for keywords?

It doesn't matter if you use all caps or all lowercase—either way is perfectly acceptable! For example, `select * from my_table;` is further parsed and works just the same as `SELECT * FROM my_table;`.

## What are some useful tools and resources to learn and work with SQL?

The following is a list of cool and useful SQL-related tools. These are not affiliated with Tableland but simply being shared to help developers using the protocol:
