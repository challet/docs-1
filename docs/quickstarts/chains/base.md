## Overview

[Base](https://www.base.org/) is a Layer 2 chain built on the Optimism's OP stack. Note that developers must bridge assets from Ethereum to Base to take advantage of the faster transaction confirmation speeds and low costs.

## Setup & resources

<ChainSection chainName='base-sepolia' />
<ChainSection chainName='base' />

### Getting testnet funds

If you request testnet Ether from a faucet noted above, it should go direct to the testnet. However, you can also request funds from the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and bridge it. You must move the ETH from Ethereum to Base at the URL listed aboveâ€”i.e., select "ETH" (or, as in the screenshot below, other ERC20 tokens that exist on Ethereum Sepolia can be bridged).
